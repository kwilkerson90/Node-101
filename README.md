# Node-101

This file contains in-class practice with Node. Some of the exercises include creating a server, initializing a new package, DNS lookup, reading a file, and writing to a file. I also included notes from my research within each exercise. This lesson was helpful for learning by doing, building muscle memory, and learning some of the foundational aspects of Node.
